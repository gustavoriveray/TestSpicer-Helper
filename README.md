# Set Up

You need to go and register at [TestSpicer](https://www.testspicer.com) and grab your API Key

Then paste it on to the config variable in the TestSpicerAPI file of your preference.

testSpicerExample.py and TestSpicerExample.rb contain just examples on how to call within your tests or code, no need to download those
